## 💰 Pricing Logic

### Base Pricing
```typescript
const HEALTHCARE_PACKAGES = [
  {
    id: 'pkg_basic',
    name: 'basic',
    displayName: 'Basic Care',
    price: 9999,
    duration: 6,
    features: [/* 6 features */]
  },
  {
    id: 'pkg_medium',
    name: 'medium',
    displayName: 'Standard Care',
    price: 19999,
    duration: 9,
    features: [/* 8 features */],
    popular: true
  },
  {
    id: 'pkg_comprehensive',
    name: 'comprehensive',
    displayName: 'Premium Care',
    price: 34999,
    duration: 12,
    features: [/* 11 features */]
  }
];
```

### Price Calculation Formula
```
Subtotal = Sum of selected package prices
Discount = 10% (for 2 packages) or 15% (for 3 packages)
After Discount = Subtotal - Discount
GST = After Discount × 18%
Total Amount = After Discount + GST
```

### Example Calculations

**Single Package (Standard Care):**
- Subtotal: ₹19,999
- Discount: ₹0 (no discount for single package)
- GST: ₹3,600 (18%)
- **Total: ₹23,599**

**Two Packages (Basic + Standard):**
- Subtotal: ₹29,998
- Discount: ₹3,000 (10%)
- After Discount: ₹26,998
- GST: ₹4,860 (18%)
- **Total: ₹31,858**

**All Three Packages:**
- Subtotal: ₹64,997
- Discount: ₹9,750 (15%)
- After Discount: ₹55,247
- GST: ₹9,944 (18%)
- **Total: ₹65,191**
