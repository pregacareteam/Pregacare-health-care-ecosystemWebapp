## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **1. User Account Layer (Single Identity)**
```javascript
// One user account for Dr. Sarah Johnson
{
  "id": "user_12345",

    { "role": "doctor", "status": "active" },
    { "role": "nutritionist", "status": "active" }
  ],
  "currentRole": "doctor"
}
```

### **2. Provider Service Layer (Multiple Professional Identities)**
```javascript
// Separate service profiles for each professional role
{
  "providerServices": [
    {
      "id": "doctor_001",          // Unique medical service ID
      "userId": "user_12345",      // Links to Dr. Sarah's account
      "roleType": "doctor",
      "displayName": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Provider Service Manager**
```typescript
class ProviderServiceManager {
  // Generate unique IDs: doctor_001, doctor_002, etc.
  static generateProviderId(roleType: string): string
  
  // Create service profile for each role
  static createProviderService(userId: string, roleType: string): ProviderServiceProfile
  
  // Get all service profiles for a user
  static getUserProviderProfiles(userId: string): ProviderServiceProfile[]
  
  // Get specific service by provider ID
  static getProviderProfile(providerId: string): ProviderServiceProfile
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Authentication**
```typescript
// Registration handles service creation
const signUp = async (email, password, userData) => {
  const user = createOrUpdateUser(email, userData);
  
  if (userData.role !== 'patient') {
    // Create unique provider service ID
    ProviderServiceManager.createProviderService(
      user.id, 
      userData.role, 
      { displayName: userData.name, specialization: userData.specialization }
    );
  }
}
```

### **3. Appointment & Communication System**
```typescript
// Appointments reference provider service IDs
interface ServiceAppointment {
  providerId: string;        // "doctor_001" or "nutritionist_001" 
  providerUserId: string;    // Links to actual user account
  serviceType: string;       // Context for the service
}

// Communications are service-aware
interface ServiceCommunication {
  senderProviderId?: string;    // If from provider, which service
  receiverProviderId?: string;  // Which service to receive
}
```
